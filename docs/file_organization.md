# File Organization

Keeping your files organized from the beginning will save you a lot of time later. WSP provides two main locations for storing your work, and they serve different purposes.

## Home Directory (`$HOME`)

Your home directory is the best place for things that are relatively small but important, such as:

- Scripts
- Programs
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Reference files
- Final results

Your home directory is backed up periodically, but storage space is limited. Try not to use it for large datasets.

## Scratch Directory (`scratch`)

Use your personal scratch directory for files that take up a lot of space, including:

- Raw sequencing data
- Intermediate files
- Large project folders
- Temporary analysis results

Unlike your home directory, **scratch is not backed up**. Make sure important data exist somewhere else before relying on scratch as your only copy.

## Organizing Projects

At the moment, the lab does not use a standard project structure, so everyone organizes their work a little differently.

One possible layout is:

```text
project_name/
├── metadata/
├── raw_data/
├── filtered_data/
├── scripts/
├── results/
├── figures/
├── logs/
└── README.md
```

This isn't a rule, just one way to keep projects organized and easy to navigate.

## A Few Good Habits

- Keep related files together.
- Use descriptive file and folder names.
- Store large files in `scratch`.
- Keep code and important results in `$HOME`.
- Add a short README describing your project whenever possible.
